# FSM-Unity3D
A basic implementation of state machine in Unity3D.


FSM in game development is a necessory paradigm and aids in development and implementation of a lot of behaviours including play controller, animation system, menu system, AI controller, game manager etc. This specific implementation uses Unity3D's call back methods to implement states and their transitions. It contains two scripts State.cs and StateMachine. Any Script which requiers FSM behaviour, can implement StateMachine class.
